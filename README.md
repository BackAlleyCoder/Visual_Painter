# Visual_Painter
VisualPainter is a gesture-controlled drawing application that leverages real-time hand tracking to provide an intuitive and responsive user experience. With a quick 100 ms response time, the application allows users to draw and erase using single-finger gestures, while two-finger gestures are used for color or eraser selection. Additionally, the system integrates gesture-based recognition of four predefined shapes—circle, rectangle, triangle, and line—with an impressive 95% accuracy. The project demonstrates seamless human-computer interaction, featuring a simple and intuitive interface designed for ease of use.
